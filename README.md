# Shortcode Carousel

## Description
Omeka Classic plugin that adds a shortcode to create a carousel of items using jCarousel.

The basic shortcode is `[carousel]`. 
The shortcode `[recent_carousel]` and `[featured_carousel]` are shortcuts to creating a carousel of recent and featured items, respectively.

## Installation
Uncompress files and rename plugin folder "ShortcodeCarousel".

Then install it like any other Omeka plugin.

## Plugin specific options
- **speed**: sets the speed for the scrolling animation. May be "fast", "slow", or a time in milliseconds. Default is 400. For example: `[carousel speed=slow]` or `[carousel speed=500]`
- **autoscroll**: setting autoscroll=true will make the items automatically scroll
- **interval**: when autoscroll is on, interval sets the interval between scrolling in milliseconds. Default is 3000. For example: `[carousel autoscroll=true interval=700]`
- **pauseonhover**: setting pauseonhover=true will temporarily pause the carousel's scrolling when mouse will be hovering over it. For example: `[carousel pauseonhover=true]`
- **showtitles**: setting showtitles=true will display the item title in the carousel. For example: `[carousel showtitles=true]`
- **showtitlesastooltips**: setting showtitlesastooltips=true will use the item title as text for image's tooltip in the carousel. For example: `[carousel  showtitles=true showtitlesastooltips=true]`
- **hidenavigation**: setting hidenavigation=true will hide the carousel's navigation bar. For example: `[carousel hidenavigation=true]`

## Item shortcode general options
The carousel shortcode uses also the following options, defined for Items:
- **is_featured**, with 1 or 0
- **user**, with user id
- **ids**, with a range of id
- **sort_field**, with a sort field
- **sort_dir**, with the sort dir "a" or "d"
- **collection**, with the collection id
- **num**, with the number of items to show

## Usage outside of Simple Pages
Theme developers may add support for usage anywhere on their Omeka site. For example, you could create a theme setting called Carousel (as an HTML text area where a user might place the shortcode) and add the following to your homepage or other theme template.
```
<?php
    $t = get_theme_option('Carousel');
    echo $this->shortcodes($t);
?>
```

## Warning
Use it at your own risk.

Itâ€™s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.
